# Mancala580
HTML, CSS, and JS rendered Mancala game

Pebbles were not rendered in. I found it easier to start with numbers and after I got it working I tried to render in the pebbles and it made my program no longer functional so I played it safe and kept the numbers in. All rules should work well and there aren't any bugs I've found yet.
